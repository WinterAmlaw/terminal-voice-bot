This project is a Node.js voice-controlled terminal assistant. Use modular structure: stt (speech-to-text), nlp (OpenAI command parsing), executor (terminal command execution), tts (optional text-to-speech), config, and main entry point. Maintain clear context and task lists for Copilot. Prioritize safety and extensibility.
